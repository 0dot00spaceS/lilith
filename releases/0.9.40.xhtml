		<h2>Changes</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Added "Find previous active" (*command* T) and "Find next active" (*command* shift T) functionality
				to quickly jump to events that match any active condition.
				<br/>(<a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/lilith/ticket/93">Ticket 93</a>)			
			</li>
			
			<li>
				Added "Export" functionality which exports the currently selected view into a Lilith file.
				<br/>(<a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/lilith/ticket/92">Ticket 92</a>)			
			</li>
			
			<li>
				Added default condition name to preferences. It's preselected for every new view.<br />
				This was suggested by Lothar Cezanne.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				Polling events every 100ms instead of every 2s.<br />
				This results in less congestion and a much snappier feeling.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				Fixed deployment of site.<br />
				See <a href="http://sulky.huxhorn.de/projects/">sulky</a> and <a href="http://lilith.huxhorn.de/projects/">lilith</a>.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				Added --export-preferences &lt;file&gt; and --import-preferences &lt;file&gt; 
				commandline options to be able to export and import all preferences.
				<br/>This was requested by Gareth Doutch (gdoutch).
				<br/>(<a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/lilith/ticket/81">Ticket 81</a>)			
			</li>
			
			<li>
				Added an additional executable lilith-all.jar containing all dependencies as
				another download option.
				<br/>This was requested by Adrien Sales.
			</li>

			<li>
				Added ability to define a sound for WARN-level events, but without any assigned default sound.
				<br/>This was requested by Adrien Sales.
			</li>

			<li>
				Added F1 as shortcut for Help.
				<br/>This was requested by Adrien Sales.
			</li>

			<li>
				Fixed several issue in case of log files that are recreated by
				&lt;append&gt;false&lt;/append&gt; in FileAppender.
				<br/>Those were all raised by Jeff Jensen (jeffjensen). Thank you very much!
				<br/>(<a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/lilith/ticket/84">Ticket 84</a>)			
				<br/>(<a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/lilith/ticket/88">Ticket 88</a>)			
				<br/>(<a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/lilith/ticket/90">Ticket 90</a>)			
			</li>

			<li>
				Fixed the regression that the internal Lilith log wouldn't show up in the menu anymore.
				<br/>(<a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/lilith/ticket/85">Ticket 85</a>)			
			</li>
			
			<li>
				Changed update interval of opened files from 5 seconds to 1 second.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				Groovy 1.7.3
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		<h2>Known Issues</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Selection in the HTML view is currently somewhat buggy, especially in case of scaled view.
				This is a limitation of Flying Saucer that's used as the XHTML renderer.
			</li>
			<li>cat and tail are currently still experimental features.
			<br/>AccessEvent isn't (and can't be) supported yet. LoggingEvent isn't
			fully supported, either.
			</li>
		</ul>
