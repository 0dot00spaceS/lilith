<ul>
    <li>
		Canceling an Export does not delete the data and index files - even though there's code
		that's supposed to do exactly that.
		<br/>
		Take a look at the internal Lilith log. The "WTF??" is printed in exactly this situation.
		<br/>
		Feel free to find out what's going wrong here. It's actually quite hot right now so it might
		be a brain-issue ;) - enlighten me!
    </li>

    <li>Selection in the HTML view is currently somewhat buggy, especially in case of scaled view.
        This is a limitation of Flying Saucer that's used as the XHTML renderer.
    </li>

    <li>'Copy event' was meant to copy the event as HTML but this is severely broken in Java.<br/>
        There's no workaround available but this will *probably* be fixed in JDK7.
        So for now, 'Copy event' copies the XHTML code as text...<br/>
        See <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6392086">bug #6392086</a>.
    </li>

	<li>Preferences dialog is obviously not finished right now :)</li>

	<li>The 'Send to' functionality isn't working as expected if the network infrastructure changes.
		It should work but doesn't. I think it's a JmDNS problem but I have to investigate further.
	</li>
