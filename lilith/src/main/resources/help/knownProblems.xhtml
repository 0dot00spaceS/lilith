<ul>
    <li>
		Canceling an Export does not delete the data and index files - even though there's code
		that's supposed to do exactly that.
		<br/>
		Take a look at the internal Lilith log. The "WTF??" is printed in exactly this situation.
		<br/>
		Feel free to find out what's going wrong here. It's actually quite hot right now so it might
		be a brain-issue ;) - enlighten me!

	<li>Flying Saucer related issues:
		<ul>
			<li>Selection in the HTML view is currently somewhat buggy, especially in case of scaled view.
				<br/>See <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/flying-saucer/issues/79">Issue 79: SelectionHighlighter not compatible with ScalableXHTMLPanel</a>
			</li>

			<li>The first line of the message in HTML view is not properly indented if it starts with whitespace. You can see this effect by examining the event created by LogPinupLargeRunnable (executed via "Log ASCII"). The HTML created is actually correct.
				<br/>See <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/flying-saucer/issues/125">Issue 125: &lt;pre&gt; ignores leading whitespace</a>
			</li>

			<li>Jumping to anchors is currently not supported so the navigation in help and details view isn't as good as it could be.
				<br/>See <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/flying-saucer/issues/105">Issue 105: URLs with anchors</a>
